## Electronic Components Supplier with RoHS Compliance

RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) is a European Union directive aimed at minimizing the environmental and health impact of electronic waste. It restricts the use of certain hazardous substances commonly found in electronics manufacturing.

### Substances Restricted Under RoHS
1. Lead (Pb)  
2. Mercury (Hg)  
3. Cadmium (Cd)  
4. Hexavalent Chromium (Cr6+)  
5. Polybrominated Biphenyls (PBB)  
6. Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDE)  
7. Bis(2-Ethylhexyl) Phthalate (DEHP)  
8. Butyl Benzyl Phthalate (BBP)  
9. Dibutyl Phthalate (DBP)  
10. Diisobutyl Phthalate (DIBP)  

RoHS-compliant suppliers ensure all components are verified to contain none of these substances beyond the allowable limits, making them safe for global manufacturing and consumer use.
